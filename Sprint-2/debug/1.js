// Predict and explain first...

function sum(a, b) {
  return;
  a + b;
}

console.log(`The sum of 10 and 32 is ${sum(10, 32)}`);

// the function have declaration sum with 2 arguments (a,b) the return statement ends the function immediately.
// Anything after return on a new line is ignored and returns undefined every time it is called.
// To Fix = If I place a + b on the same line as return
 
// The function supposed to look like this: 
//function sum(a, b) {
 // return a + b;
//}

//console.log(`The sum of 10 and 32 is ${sum(10, 32)}`);

// The Answer will be = The sum of 10 and 32 is 42
